##

After I print out all the classes (attached) I manually do the schedule.  MFO does not pick up the length of the repertoire, it only picks up what we put in per student, so it is not accurate enough for me.  I keep changing the syllabus to include the time per person + time of repertoire.  
Next, I use (parts summary) info to schedule.  The scheduler gives me the program for each day.  Right now when I print out the program it is giving me 0 before each participant in the classes, don't know why, never did that before.  Now I will have to through the program and number the students.

With total fees I can cross check with e-transfers received to see if everyone paid.
With scheduler I can see the sessions for each venue "voice program" (wrong title, this is the schedule for voice)
Preliminary Program is what I have programmed so far.

## Roll over to a new year

The Roll over 2018 is how we move from one year to another, so far it works.

Larry Johnston was the man who wrote the program for the Alberta festivals (where he lived) and you will see lots of stuff relating to other festivals.  When we do the roll over, under preferences, we put in our festival and even though there's stuff in there we don't use, the program is a big help.
