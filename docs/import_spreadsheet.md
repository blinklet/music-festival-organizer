Use Pandas to read in spreadsheet, then convert it into various dataframes, then place in SQL tables

Maybe first implement a Flask database dashboard? *[Flask-Admin](https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin)*




Use the *[pypostal](https://github.com/openvenues/pypostal)* package which is the official Python wrapper for *[Libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal)*

(install prerquisites before installing package)

```
sudo apt-get install curl autoconf automake libtool python-dev pkg-config
pip install postal
```

But, libpostal seems to be a heavy, ML-backed solution?
