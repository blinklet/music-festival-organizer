# Tools and Packages used

The tools and packages I use and why I use them.

## Documentation tools

I am first developing a requirements document and needed to choose the tools I will use to render it when sharing the output with my customers.

* **vscode** text editor
  * **Markdown Preview Mermaid Support** extension by Matt Bierner
  * **Python** extension by Microsoft
* **[PanDoc](https://pandoc.org/)** for rendering Markdown to a variety of readable document formats
  * **[Diagram Generator](https://github.com/pandoc-ext/diagram)** extension
* **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)** markdown diagram tool for [creating diagrams with embedded text](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/)

## Project tools

* GitHub
* Docker

## Development tools

* Python
* Flask
* PostgeSQL
* SQLAlchemy

## Potential development tools

* [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) + [Flask](): Add interactivity to web pages without Javascript
* [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/)

## Learning

Things I need to learn now or later:

* Mermaid diagram markup
* Type hints in Python
  * [Python type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
  * 
* Using a debugger
  * [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html), the official Python debugger
  * [VSCode tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging)
  * [DigitalOcean PBD tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-python-debugger)
* Python unit tests (PyTest?)
* More advanced Flask usage
* Database design

Probably should eventually learn

* Modern HTML
* CSS
* DOM
